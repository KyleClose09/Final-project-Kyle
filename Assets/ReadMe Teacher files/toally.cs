  //Hi Ally
  //i was quite dissapointed to see that my marks came in on the second last day of school
  //but it is what it is and i hope to take this course again in the sring maybe if all goes south
  //for my lighting i used direction lights to give a light to all my obejects and removed 
  //any unessesary shadows
  //i also added red from the bottom with blue on the sides to give some controversy and direction
  //the animation i added was attatched to a sound that runs back and fourth the cell to give a more ominous feeling
  //overall i am happy with the result thou it isnt perfect there lots id like to add but
  //none the less
  //merry christmas,
  //kyle
