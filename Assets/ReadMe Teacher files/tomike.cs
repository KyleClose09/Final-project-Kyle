//Hi Mike, 
//there were alot of things i wanted to add via code that i couldnt like a timer 
//and a game over sequence if the timer wasnt met 
//or a better code for the panel
//but overall im happy that i was able to get the basics of what i wanted 
//the hardest task was getting those colliders mapped on my scene and some parts are 
//still not colliding proprly at times but overall it runs well
//ive spent more time trying to fix the teleporter then id have liked but with enough tries it will work
//thank you and merry christmas
//kyle.
