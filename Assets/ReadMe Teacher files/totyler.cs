//Hi Tyler,
//so for the sounds i used alot of basic animation sounds ie clicking buttons, door creek on
//opening, faucet dripping.
//others include vader breathing in the background to give more ominimity
//the radio static noise is loud and directs the player to it so u can see where to start the game at
//the directions r used to help the player type in the code for the vent.
//for my photogrammetry i used my ship as a look good piece at the end number one the photogram
//itself look amazing and number 2 it works with my escape theme.
//thank you tyler
//have a merry Christmas
//Kyle
